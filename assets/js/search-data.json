            "content": "Significant Figures . When working in class, especially with our equipment that isn’t’t worth millions of dollars, we can’t be sure that the measurements we get are completely accurate, we could be of by a thousandth of milligram, and it would affect the final result, that is where significant figures(maybe ) come flying in, and you are able to show that you accounted for the fact that you didn’t have all the information by using the significant figure method. . Rules . Non-Zero Digits are always significant (as in, when counting out how many sig figs there are, every digit will certainly be counted) | Any zeros between two significant #’s should be counted (So if there’s something like 5005, that’s 4 sig figs | Trailing Zero’s Are Significant (After your non-zero digits finish out, and there’s still zero’s afterwards? To the right? Those are significant figures! Say you were writing out measurements and the scale came out with 2.20, that’s 3 sig figs) | Multiplication/Division and Addition/Subtraction . Multiplication/Division . For the entire number, after you’ve solved through the problem, use the least amount of significant figures from what you were originally working with . . Addition/Subtraction . Only look at the significant figures after the decimal of the numbers you are working with, and when you find your answer, on the right of your decimal, make sure it’s the amount of sig figs determined beforehand. . Important Things to Remember . Only apply significant figures after you’ve completely solved through the problem, as that will bring you the most accurate results. Also, if say you get an answer of 5000? You need to write that out in scientific notation, either as 510^3, 5.010^3, 5.00*10^3, etc. . Conclusion . And those are our figures that are significant, will help you read some multiple choice answers and might be nice to remember on some tests .",

Our detested rule, working hard every day to make every problem just that tiniest bit harder (or, who am I kidding, way harder) in it’s confounding nested ways, lets discuss this bringer of pain. . What is chain rule? . When you’ve got a function inside a function (f(g(x))), and you decide that you must take the derivative of it, chain rule is forced upon your soul, as it is the method used in these situations . The Method . The derivative of f(g(x)) is (f prime (g(x)) * g prime (x)), illustrated below, . . But did you think it ended there? No no, that’s chain rule for those not tortured in life, what we will see is nested chain rule, which is just following the same process but ends up getting pretty confusing, make sure you know exactly how it works before it ends up on your tests in it’s great fashion . . Conclusion . Yup, that was shackle rule, our one true friend, hope this got you back on track! .",

Admittedly one the the simpler concepts learned for derivatives, that sets the base for most operations in the future, in this article it’ll largely be a refresher in the case you’ve forgotten . What is Power Rule? . Power Rule, in it’s applied state, is just knowing that the derivative of bx^n = nbx^(n-1) add image here of showing this but in nicer forma . Or rather to speak of it’s actual significance, it’s the base derivative format you’ll use in almost every situation you deal with derivatives in the future, set up by extremely tedious limit work that one suffers on . That’s Right, Definition of the Derivative . Does this phrasing bring you bad memories? Me too! Well, you can’t escape from it, as it’ll show up in both AP Calculus AB and BC, so here’s the a few formats you might see . . I’d highly recommend memorizing all of these, as you might not have to solve it, but, hint hint, it’ll help you through a few multiple choice problems in the future if you know how these work, here’s a link to a tutorial on how to solve through them. You might think I’m lazy, but I’m actually just pragmatic, they’ll explain it better than I ever could with a few images. . Conclusion . That’s pretty much the most important parts of power rule and it’s annoying subset, but don’t tell your teachers I paired them together, as definition of the derivative isn’t just for power rule (See: trig and log derivatives). Hope it’s a nice refresher! .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
